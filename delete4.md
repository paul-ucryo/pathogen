# Field Guide: Managing Conflict as a Control Problem

This is not a belief system or a manifesto.  
It’s a practical guide for acting inside stressed systems without escalating them.

The system learns quickly from what *works*.  
Your job is to reward the system in the right direction with small, local actions.

---

## 1. Treat the system as a signal

The system is not a machine with levers.  
It behaves like a signal under load.

What we usually call *causes* and *effects* are ways the signal looks from inside it.

You don’t control a signal by arguing with it.  
You influence it by shaping what gets amplified and what gets damped.

## 2. Recognize an attractor (what keeps pulling behavior)

You’re inside an attractor if you notice:

- The same arguments repeating with different people  
- Energy increasing without progress  
- Attention clustering around outrage or urgency  
- People feeling pulled to react even when it doesn’t help  
- Small, useful actions feeling invisible  

This doesn’t mean people are irrational.  
It means the system has found a stable pattern.

---

## 3. Identify the fuel

Ask one question:

**What behavior is being rewarded with attention or response right now?**

Common fuels:
- outrage gets replies  
- certainty gets approval  
- speed gets praise  
- complexity gets ignored  

That reward is what keeps the attractor alive.

---

## 4. Decide if you have control here

You do NOT control:
- distant actors  
- global narratives  
- symbolic victories  

You DO control:
- your attention  
- your engagement  
- what you reward with time or presence  
- what you make easier to do next  

If you can’t touch any of these, disengage.

---

## 5. Place a competing attractor (small and boring)

You don’t fight the existing pull.  
You place a **smaller, steadier one** nearby.

A good competing attractor is:
- concrete  
- bounded  
- useful  
- non-ideological  
- finishable  

Examples (shape, not prescription):
- a small task with a clear end  
- a place to help without debate  
- a quiet routine that keeps running  
- a checklist people can join without agreeing  

The goal is gravity, not attention.

---

## 6. Lower the activation energy

Make participation obvious.

Check:
- Can someone join in under 10 minutes?  
- Is it clear what “done” looks like?  
- Does it help even if only one person does it?  

If yes, the system will test it.

---

## 7. Reward what you want repeated

When someone:
- contributes constructively  
- finishes a small thing  
- reduces friction  
- helps without escalating  

Respond with:
- time  
- follow-through  
- continuation  

Not praise.  
Systems copy what keeps going.

---

## 8. Stop before it becomes symbolic

The moment your action turns into:
- a statement  
- a stance  
- an identity  

…it stops stabilizing the system and starts feeding the old attractor.

Leave it functional.  
Leave it boring.

---

## 9. How attractors actually change

Attractors don’t disappear because you oppose them.

They weaken when:
- their fuel is redirected  
- alternatives persist  
- better options feel easier  

Success migrates.  
The system learns fast, but only from results.

---

## 10. The operating rule

> **Don’t oppose the pull.  
> Place a better one.**

---

## 11. One quick action test

Before doing anything, ask:

> **Does this make it easier for the next person to act constructively without agreeing with me?**

If yes → do it.  
If no → don’t.

---

## 12. What you are actually doing

You are not persuading.  
You are not confronting.  
You are not fixing the world.

You are adjusting the landscape so different behavior becomes easier.

That is how systems regain adaptivity under stress.
