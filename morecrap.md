# Intent, Learning, and System Change  
*A design metric for access tools*

---

## Premise

Assume the brain is fundamentally a **learning system**.

From that premise, several consequences follow:

- Learning never turns off.
- “Engagement,” “attention,” and “intent” are expressions of how learning effort is allocated.
- At every decision point, behavior tends toward **minimizing expected model update cost**.

This document defines a design metric that emerges when **user intent** and **system responsibility** are separated but expressed in the same learning currency.

## Two Competing Optimizations

### User Intent: Optimize the Self (Local)

From the user’s perspective:

- Prefer environments where updates are cheap
- Reinforce known distinctions
- Increase confidence and competence
- Reduce uncertainty and restructuring

This is **local learning efficiency**.

The user is not choosing stagnation; they are choosing the *cheapest available learning*.

### System Objective: Optimize System Change (Global)

From the system’s perspective:

- Preserve adaptability over time
- Maintain access to multiple regions of state space
- Prevent hardening into narrow engagement planes
- Keep future learning affordable

This is **global learning capacity**.

The system is not opposing the user; it is protecting *future learning optionality*.

## Shared Currency: Learning Cost

Both objectives can be expressed in the same units:

- **Update cost**: the effort required to restructure or extend the internal model
- **Progress**: meaningful change achieved per unit cost
- **Coverage**: how much of the state space remains reachable at reasonable cost

This allows intent and system health to be compared without moral framing.

## The Design Metric: Learning Curvature

Define two quantities:
