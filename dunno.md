# Field Manual: Building Support Structures in Stressed Systems

This is a practical guide for acting inside high-pressure environments.
It assumes:
- the system is already full of energy
- ideology increases friction
- the system learns success sharply, even when that success causes damage

The goal is not to win conflicts.
The goal is to **make the system adaptive** by shaping attractors.

## How to Use This

1. Identify which problem you are seeing.
2. Check the conditions.
3. Apply the smallest matching structure.
4. Stop once the structure runs without you.

You are not the solution.
You are a temporary stabilizer.

## Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **If an action does not change incentives, attention, or friction, it is expression — not control.**

Expression is fine.
Don’t confuse it with leverage.

## The Five Common Problems (and What to Do)

---

## 1. Escalation Loops

### What it looks like
- Repeating arguments
- Rising urgency
- People talking past each other
- Attention rewards outrage

### Conditions
- High emotional load
- Low trust
- Fast feedback (social media, crowds, crises)

### What NOT to do
- Argue harder
- Add context
- Demand agreement
- Call out hypocrisy

### Support Structure to Build
**A bounded alternative that absorbs energy**

Examples:
- A small task station (“help with X, 10 minutes max”)
- A recurring, boring action that continues regardless of debate
- A visible checklist that converts emotion into completion

Why it works:
- Escalation is an attractor fed by attention
- Completion is a competing attractor fed by usefulness

---

## 2. Paralysis / Analysis Freeze

### What it looks like
- Endless discussion
- Fear of doing the wrong thing
- Demand for perfect information
- Nothing actually happens

### Conditions
- High uncertainty
- High perceived stakes
- Social punishment for mistakes

### What NOT to do
- Push urgency
- Shame indecision
- Force consensus

### Support Structure to Build
**Reversible, low-risk action paths**

Examples:
- “Try this for one week”
- Pilot projects
- Prototypes with explicit rollback
- Time-boxed experiments

Why it works:
- The system is avoiding irreversible loss
- Reversibility lowers fear and unlocks motion

---

## 3. Burnout and Disengagement

### What it looks like
- People disappearing
- Cynicism
- “What’s the point?”
- Only the loudest remain

### Conditions
- Sustained stress
- No visible progress
- High moral pressure

### What NOT to do
- Guilt people into staying
- Increase demands
- Frame disengagement as failure

### Support Structure to Build
**Sustainable participation roles**

Examples:
- Clear limits (“2 hours/week max”)
- Rotating responsibility
- Permission to step back without penalty
- Work that completes cleanly

Why it works:
- Systems collapse when participation requires self-erasure
- Sustainability is an attractor

---

## 4. Fragmentation into Sides

### What it looks like
- Identity hardening
- “Us vs them”
- Loyalty tests
- Loss of shared language

### Conditions
- Meaning collapse
- Competing stabilization strategies
- Pressure to signal belonging

### What NOT to do
- Argue beliefs
- Demand neutrality
- Create meta-debates about framing

### Support Structure to Build
**Non-ideological coordination points**

Examples:
- Shared resources
- Mutual aid without slogans
- Skill-based contribution (“can you do X?”)
- Problem-specific collaboration

Why it works:
- People can coordinate without agreeing
- Function creates common ground faster than discourse

---

## 5. Symbolic Action Without Impact

### What it looks like
- Performative gestures
- High visibility, low effect
- Constant messaging, little change

### Conditions
- Distant problems
- Inaccessible decision-makers
- Media-driven incentives

### What NOT to do
- Escalate symbolism
- Confuse attention with impact
- Shame people for disengaging

### Support Structure to Build
**Local, replicable success**

Examples:
- Help a community you can reach
- Document what worked
- Make it easy for others to copy
- Let results travel, not arguments

Why it works:
- Systems learn from success
- Replication beats persuasion

---

## Attractor Rule of Thumb

> **Don’t fight attractors.  
> Starve bad ones.  
> Feed better ones.**

Attractors change when:
- fuel is redirected
- alternatives persist
- participation feels easier

---

## Giving Up Ideology (When Necessary)

Ideology is useful for meaning.
It is harmful for coordination under load.

Give it up when:
- it blocks participation
- it increases friction
- it turns work into signaling
- it prevents reversible action

This is not betrayal.
It is **control discipline**.

---

## Personal Control Boundary

You control:
- where your attention goes
- what behavior you reward
- which structures you help run

You do NOT control:
- global outcomes
- other people’s beliefs
- system-level resolution

Act accordingly.

---

## Final Operating Principle

> **Do the smallest clear thing that makes constructive behavior easier to repeat.**

That is how decentralized systems become stable.
