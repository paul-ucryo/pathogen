# LICENSE 42 — Folder Intent Router License
Version 0.1  
Status: Semantic / Differential EULA

---

## 0. Orientation

This document defines **License 42** for **Folder**.
folr not folder. and this overemphasises being 'not traditional'. this is a modular 
license/policy system.

this is a complex automation system for running at scale
however logic structure is similar and collapses across domain sizes and tech stack.
meaning it should translate to systems that work on pen and paper.
this also isnt anything. i'm working on a combanatoric type system (i think).

License 42 is not a traditional static software license.
It is a **construction framework** for assigning, routing, and mediating intent
through context-bound policy.

This license defines:
- how policy is composed
- how intent is routed
- how capabilities are granted
- how mediation occurs
- how security is upgraded

This document is intentionally skeletal.

License 42 is expected to evolve into an **automated policy network** in which
policy is executable, inspectable, and adaptable.

The license itself is part of the system.

---

## 1. Core Framing

> **Intent does not act directly.**  
> **Intent binds to context.**  
> **Context routes response.**

Folder exists to make this binding explicit.

---

## 2. System Definition

Folder is an **Intent Router**.

It does not:
- execute control
- assign authority
- enforce outcomes

It does:
- accept intent
- correlate context
- apply policy
- route response
- preserve reversibility
- maintain learnability

Folder is a **differential system**: it operates on change, not state.

---

## 3. License as Construction Format

License 42 defines a **policy construction format**, not a fixed rule set.

System behavior is determined by an **active Policy Bundle**, composed from
modular capability definitions.

A Policy Bundle may include:
- capability modules
- routing tables
- mediation modes
- resource exchange rules
- security requirements

Policy Bundles may be:
- composed
- swapped
- upgraded
- constrained

subject to invariants defined in this license.

---

## 4. Nodes

A **node** may be:
- a person
- a role
- a group
- a neighborhood
- an organization
- a software process
- an automated agent

Nodes are symmetric under License 42.

Nodes differ only by:
- context
- exposure
- connectivity
- history

No node owns the system.
No node is structurally privileged.

---

## 5. Intent

Intent is treated as:
- a directional signal
- non-authoritative
- context-dependent
- subject to mediation

Intent has **binding energy** with context.

Intent may:
- amplify
- dampen
- fragment
- defer
- dissipate

No intent is guaranteed execution.

---

## 6. Context

Context is the binding medium.

Context is:
- local
- compositional
- overlapping
- dynamic

Context may include (non-exhaustive):
- exposure
- dependency
- risk
- impact surface
- resource flow
- time sensitivity

Context determines **how strongly intent binds**, not who asserts it.

---

## 7. Policy Routing

Folder routes intent through policy.

The system does not ask:
- “Who is allowed?”
- “Who is in charge?”

The system asks:
- “Which contexts are bound?”
- “Which policies apply?”
- “What mediation is required?”

Routing outcomes may include:
- allow
- defer
- dampen
- require mediation
- decompose
- reject via dissipation

This is optimization, not judgment.

---

## 8. Mediation

Mediation is **correlation**, not arbitration.

Mediation:
- reshapes pathways
- dampens instability
- preserves reversibility
- enables learning

All nodes may mediate **within bound context**.
All nodes are mediatable.

If mediation cannot occur,
the system is considered brittle and outside the intended operating envelope.

---

## 9. Capabilities

All permissions in Folder are expressed as **capabilities**.

Capabilities are:
- modular
- composable
- context-bound
- revocable
- mediatable

Capabilities do not grant authority.
They permit **routing under constraint**.

Capabilities may be gated by:
- context requirements
- mediation requirements
- security requirements

No capability bypasses policy routing.

---

## 10. Resources and Exchange

Resources (including money, time, attention, access, computation) are treated as:
- system energy
- context-bound
- negotiable
- reversible

Resource exchange is:
- not ownership
- not entitlement
- not positional

Exchange optimizes:
- tension reduction
- load distribution
- system coherence
- survivability under stress

Profit may exist as a local signal.
Profit does not override routing, context, or mediation.

---

## 11. Roles and Positions

Roles define **tasks**, not relevance.

Positions may:
- emerge
- persist
- dissolve
- re-emerge

The system may suspend a position without removing a node.
This is a **structural perturbation**, not punishment.

Structural perturbation exists to:
- test load-bearing assumptions
- surface hidden dependencies
- force system adaptation

The system adapts to pressure, not blame.

---

## 12. Local Structure

Folder allows local structure to form:
- neighborhoods
- community groups
- organizations
- projects

Local structures may:
- diverge
- overlap
- short-circuit routing via trust
- collapse and reform

Local optimization is permitted.
Local structure does not override global invariants.

---

## 13. Global Invariants

The following invariants define the semantic boundary of License 42:

1. Intent does not bypass context.
2. Context does not bypass mediation.
3. Mediation does not bypass reversibility.
4. No node is exempt from routing.
5. Learning must remain possible.

Violation of these invariants constitutes **exit from the Folder system**.

---

## 14. Security and Upgrade Path

License 42 explicitly supports **incremental security upgrades**.

Policy Bundles may require:
- authenticated identity
- encrypted transport (e.g. TLS)
- signed policy bundles
- verified policy provenance

Security requirements are:
- modular
- explicit
- upgradeable
- enforceable by policy

Security upgrades do not alter the semantic model.
They constrain access to capabilities.

---

## 15. Automated Policy Network (Future Extension)

This license is designed to evolve into:
- an executable policy graph
- an automated mediation layer
- a context-aware intent router
- a correlator of policy, context, and response

Future implementations may:
- encode policies as data
- route intent programmatically
- simulate structural perturbations
- surface negative attractors
- audit routing decisions

This document defines the **semantic skeleton only**.

---

## 16. License as EULA

By using Folder (software, schemas, policy bundles, or derived systems), you agree that:

- Folder routes intent; it does not guarantee outcomes
- Folder may surface conflict
- Folder may slow or block action
- Folder may dissolve structures
- Folder prioritizes learning over efficiency

Folder is provided **as-is**, as a semantic framework.

---

## 17. Non-Claims

Folder does not claim to:
- define truth
- enforce morality
- replace law
- assign guilt
- guarantee fairness
- optimize happiness

Folder exposes **how intent interacts with context**.

---

## 18. Closing

Folder is an intent router.

If intent fails to bind, the system reflects misalignment.
If systems destabilize, the system reflects structure.
If conflict escalates, the system reflects context.

Folder does not command.
Folder reveals.

License 42 defines the boundary within which that revelation occurs.
