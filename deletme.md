## Intent, Attention, and Semantics

This section defines a minimal mapping between **intent thermodynamics**, **attention direction**, and **semantic structure**. The goal is not completeness, but a clean basis that composes.

---

## Intent → Attention Mapping

At the highest level, intent can be classified by its **binding thermodynamics**:

- **Exothermic intent → External attention**
- **Endothermic intent → Internal attention**

This is not psychological labeling. It is a statement about **where semantic work is performed**.

---

## Exothermic Intent (External Attention)

**Definition**  
Exothermic intent binds new information cheaply into an existing model.

**Attention**
- Directed outward
- Samples the environment
- Assumes the model is “good enough”

**Semantic behavior**
- Interpretation dominates over revision
- Signals are mapped onto known distinctions
- Meaning is *applied*, not negotiated

**Dimensionality**
- Low effective dimensionality
- Many inputs collapse onto a small number of axes
- Distances are short; prediction is cheap

**Examples**
- Skill execution
- Habitual action
- Familiar exploration
- Flow states
- Most gameplay loops

---

## Endothermic Intent (Internal Attention)

**Definition**  
Endothermic intent absorbs energy to restructure the model itself.

**Attention**
- Directed inward
- Monitors error, mismatch, inconsistency
- Suspends confident prediction

**Semantic behavior**
- Model revision dominates interpretation
- New distinctions may be created
- Meaning is *rebound*, not reused

**Dimensionality**
- High effective dimensionality
- New axes are introduced or reweighted
- Distances expand; prediction is expensive

**Examples**
- Learning new frameworks
- Identity revision
- Reflection
- Social recalibration
- Early exposure to new environments

---

## Semantics as Binding Rules

Semantics do not live in signals.
They live in **binding rules**.

- Exothermic binding:  
  signals bind to existing semantics → energy released
- Endothermic binding:  
  semantics must change to bind signals → energy absorbed

Attention direction reflects **which binding rule is currently active**.

---

## Dimensionality as a Function of Intent

Intent controls the *effective dimensionality* of the semantic space:

- Exothermic intent **collapses dimensionality**
  - fewer distinctions
  - faster integration
  - higher confidence

- Endothermic intent **expands dimensionality**
  - more distinctions
  - slower integration
  - lower confidence

Learning is not movement through a fixed space.  
It is **dimensionality management over time**.

---

## Design Implication

If intent is explicit, systems can:

- respect when users want cheap binding vs restructuring
- avoid forcing endothermic load during exothermic goals
- scaffold transitions between dimensional regimes
- measure hardening as dimensional collapse
- measure overload as uncontrolled dimensional expansion

This framing treats attention, intent, and semantics as **structural properties**, not moods or traits.

---

## Summary

- Exothermic intent → external attention → semantic reuse → low dimensionality
- Endothermic intent → internal attention → semantic revision → high dimensionality
- Attention reflects where meaning is bound
- Intent controls semantic dimensionality
- Learning is the controlled expansion and collapse of that dimensionality
