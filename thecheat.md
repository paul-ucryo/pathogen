# Load-Bearing Help Infrastructure (Mediator-as-Rotation Model)

## Design Goal

Create a **load-bearing help layer** that:
- does not rely on authority, expertise, or trust in individuals
- treats participants symmetrically
- remains resilient under stress
- can exist inside or alongside existing systems
- does not require prior legitimacy to function

The system must be stable **even if you do not trust who is mediating**.

---

## Core Principle

> **If the system depends on who the mediator is, the system is not resilient.**

Therefore:
- mediation is a **role**, not a position
- mediators are **interchangeable**
- legitimacy comes from **process**, not identity

---

## Mediator as a Rotating / Randomized Role

### Why rotation matters

- Prevents concentration of power
- Prevents burnout
- Prevents capture
- Prevents moral authority from accumulating
- Ensures equality of participation

Rotation ensures:
- no one becomes load-bearing as a person
- the system remains boring, procedural, and fair
- trust is placed in the *rules*, not the *actor*

---

### Mediator selection models

Any of the following are acceptable and equivalent in principle:

#### 1. Random selection
- Mediator is chosen randomly from eligible participants
- Eligibility criteria are minimal and explicit
- Bias is replaced with statistical fairness

#### 2. Candidate randomization
- A small random subset is selected
- One accepts the role for a bounded window
- Others remain backup

#### 3. Time-sliced rotation
- Mediator role rotates on a fixed schedule
- No permanence
- No accumulation of informal power

The exact mechanism is less important than the invariant:
> **No mediator is irreplaceable.**

## What the Mediator Does (Strictly Limited)

The mediator:
- does **not** solve problems
- does **not** give advice
- does **not** judge correctness
- does **not** arbitrate truth

The mediator **only governs process**.

Allowed actions:
- enforce structure
- check scope mismatch
- slow or pause interactions
- redirect to different help modes
- terminate interactions cleanly

If a mediator exceeds this scope, the system—not the person—is at fault.

---

## Why Randomization Increases Trust

Counterintuitive but true:

- When mediators are chosen intentionally, people infer bias
- When mediators are chosen randomly, people infer neutrality
- Randomness removes suspicion of agenda
- Randomness prevents strategic behavior

This is why:
- juries use random selection
- audits use random sampling
- resilient systems avoid hand-picked gatekeepers

---

## Help Cells (Revised with Rotation)

A **help cell** is a minimal, repeatable unit.

It contains:

### 1. Request Envelope (unchanged)

A structured description of:
- type of help
- time horizon
- risk level
- exclusions

This shapes demand before engagement.

---

### 2. Bounded Helper Role (unchanged)

Helpers opt into:
- a specific, limited action
- a time-bounded contribution
- explicit limits

This shapes supply and prevents burnout.

---

### 3. Rotating Mediator (key change)

- Selected randomly or via rotation
- Active for a fixed, short window
- No special status before or after
- No long-term authority

Their job is to:
- keep the interaction survivable
- enforce reversibility
- absorb coordination friction

---

### 4. Clean Exit Paths (unchanged)

Every interaction ends as:
- resolved
- paused
- handed off
- out of scope

Exits are non-punitive and explicit.

---

## Equality as a Structural Property

The system treats participants equally because:

- no one controls entry
- no one controls narrative
- no one controls escalation
- no one owns resolution

Everyone may:
- ask for help
- offer help
- mediate
- step away

Roles rotate. Load distributes.

---

## Why This Is Resilient

This structure:
- has no single point of failure
- does not reward dominance
- does not reward charisma
- does not rely on expertise
- does not rely on trust in individuals

It survives:
- bad actors (they rotate out)
- low participation
- partial engagement
- social tension
- error

Because errors are **contained**, not amplified.

---

## Compatibility with Existing Systems

This layer:
- does not replace institutions
- does not oppose markets
- does not require consensus
- does not demand belief

It simply:
- reduces coordination failure
- absorbs social load
- lowers the cost of helping
- lowers the cost of asking

Existing systems benefit without being threatened.

---

## Key Invariant (Do Not Break This)

> **If participants feel the need to vet or trust the mediator, the system has failed.**

Resilience comes from:
- role limits
- rotation
- reversibility
- boring process

Not from good people.

---

## Final Summary

- Load-bearing systems are built from **process**, not virtue
- Mediators must be **fungible**
- Randomness is a stabilizing force
- Equality is enforced structurally, not morally
- Help becomes possible when failure is safe

This is not a platform.
It is a **protocol for survivable coordination**.
