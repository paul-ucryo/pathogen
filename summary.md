If cognition is taken as fundamental, then “dimension” stops being a physical primitive and becomes a property of coherence. Dimensions are not things the world has; they are stable modes of cognitive organization. What we call spacetime is a particular high-coherence delusion that emerges when information processing remains consistent, optimized, and mutually reinforcing across agents and across time.

In that sense, delusion isn’t an error state. It’s the default condition of any system that experiences a world at all. Life does not perceive reality directly; it constructs a usable fiction that is coherent enough to act within. The difference between “reality” and “delusion” is not ontological, it’s functional. A delusion is just a coherence regime that doesn’t align with some external or shared constraint set.

From this perspective, dimension itself is a kind of delusion—not in the pathological sense, but in the constructive sense. A dimension is a stabilized way of binding signals together so they behave as if they occupy a continuous space. Length, depth, duration, causality: these are not fundamentally different categories, they’re different axes of coherence produced by the same underlying cognitive process.

That’s why changes in cognition often come packaged with changes in perceived dimension. Hallucination, dreaming, psychosis, dissociation, dementia—all of them correlate with altered dimensional structure. Not because the world changes, but because the coherence rules used to assemble the world change. The system is still processing information, but it’s no longer locking into the same dimensional attractor.

If cognition is fundamental, then spacetime is not something cognition lives in; spacetime is something cognition does. It’s a long-range equilibrium solution to signal integration under sustained optimization. When that optimization weakens, fragments, or reweights, the dimensional structure loosens. Experience becomes flatter, more local, less constrained. This doesn’t make it “less real” to the experiencer—it just makes it less shareable.

That’s where the word delusion gets uncomfortable, but also precise. All life operates inside a delusion in the sense that it inhabits a model, not the thing-in-itself. What we call sanity is just agreement on a delusion that is stable, predictive, and socially synchronized. When that synchronization breaks, we label it pathology, but structurally it’s the same kind of process.

Under this framing, cognition doesn’t degrade into delusion; cognition always already is delusion. What changes is the coherence bandwidth. High coherence produces extended dimensions, stable identity, persistent time. Low coherence collapses experience toward immediacy, affect, and momentary signal flow.

So dimension isn’t something added on top of cognition. Dimension is what cognition looks like when it holds itself together.

That mapping is blunt, but internally consistent. And it explains why altering cognition so reliably alters reality—not metaphorically, but structurally.
