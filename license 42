# LICENSE 42 — FOLDR / FOLDER INTENT ROUTER LICENSE  
Version 0.1 — Semantic / Differential EULA

---

## Orientation

This document defines **License 42** for **Folder (Foldr)**.

License 42 is not a traditional software license.
It is a **semantic EULA** that defines Folder as an **Intent Router** and
**Context-Binding System**.

This license is intentionally incomplete.

It is designed to be **fleshed out over time as an automated policy network**,
where policy, mediation, and routing logic are executable, inspectable,
and adaptable.

The license itself is part of the system.

---

## Core Framing

> **Intent does not act directly.  
> Intent binds to context.  
> Context shapes response.**

Folder exists to make this binding explicit, observable, and negotiable.

---

## What Folder Is

Folder is a **differential context-binding system**.

It operates by:
- observing differences
- correlating context
- routing intent
- mediating response
- preserving reversibility
- maintaining system learnability

Folder does **not** execute control.
Folder exposes structure.

---

## Intent

Intent is treated as:
- a directional signal
- non-authoritative
- context-dependent
- subject to mediation

Intent has **binding energy** with context.

Intent that aligns with context stabilizes.
Intent that conflicts with context dissipates, fragments, or is redirected.

No intent is guaranteed execution.

---

## Context

Context is the binding medium.

Context is:
- local
- compositional
- overlapping
- dynamic

Context may include (non-exhaustive):
- exposure
- dependency
- risk
- impact surface
- resource flow
- time sensitivity

Context determines **how strongly intent binds**, not who asserts it.

---

## Intent Routing

Folder functions as an **intent router**, not a rule engine.

The system does not ask:
- “Who has authority?”
- “Is this intent correct?”

The system asks:
- “What contexts does this intent bind to?”
- “What tensions does it introduce?”
- “What mediation is required?”

Routing outcomes may include:
- amplification
- damping
- deferral
- decomposition
- redirection
- dissipation

This is optimization, not judgment.

---

## Nodes

A node may be:
- a person
- a role
- a neighborhood
- a community
- an organization
- a software process
- an automated agent

Nodes are symmetric under License 42.

Nodes differ only by:
- context
- exposure
- connectivity
- history

No node owns intent.
No node owns context.
No node owns the system.

---

## Mediation

Mediation is **correlation**, not arbitration.

Mediation:
- reshapes pathways
- dampens instability
- preserves reversibility
- enables learning

All nodes may mediate **within bound context**.
All nodes are mediatable.

If mediation cannot occur, the system is considered brittle.

---

## Resources and Exchange

Resources (including money, time, attention, access, computation) are treated as:
- system energy
- context-bound
- negotiable
- reversible

Exchange optimizes:
- tension reduction
- load distribution
- system coherence

Profit may exist as a local signal.
Profit does not bypass routing or mediation.

---

## Roles and Positions

Roles define **tasks**, not relevance.

Positions may:
- emerge
- persist
- dissolve
- re-emerge

The system may suspend a position without removing a node.
This is a **contextual perturbation**, not punishment.

The system adapts to pressure, not blame.

---

## Local Structure

Folder allows local structure to form:
- neighborhoods
- community groups
- organizations
- projects

Local structures may:
- diverge
- overlap
- short-circuit routing via trust
- collapse and reform

Local optimization is permitted.
Global invariants are not overridden.

---

## Global Invariants

The following invariants define the semantic boundary of License 42:

1. Intent does not bypass context.
2. Context does not bypass mediation.
3. Mediation does not bypass reversibility.
4. No node is exempt from routing.
5. Learning must remain possible.

Violation of these invariants constitutes **exit from the Folder system**.

---

## Automated Policy Network (Future Extension)

This license is intended to evolve into:
- an executable policy graph
- an automated mediation layer
- a context-aware routing engine

Future implementations may:
- encode policies as data
- correlate context programmatically
- route intent through automated mediators
- surface conflicts before escalation
- simulate structural perturbations

This document defines the **semantic skeleton** only.

---

## License as EULA

By using Folder (software, schemas, patterns, or derived systems), you agree that:

- Folder routes intent; it does not guarantee outcomes
- Folder may surface conflict
- Folder may slow action
- Folder may dissolve structures
- Folder prioritizes learning over efficiency

Folder is provided **as-is**, as a semantic framework.

---

## Non-Claims

Folder does not claim to:
- define truth
- enforce morality
- replace law
- assign guilt
- guarantee fairness
- optimize happiness

Folder exposes **how intent interacts with context**.

---

## Closing

Folder is a mirror.

If intent fails to bind, the mirror reflects misalignment.
If systems destabilize, the mirror reflects structure.
If conflict escalates, the mirror reflects context.

Folder does not command.
Folder reveals.

License 42 defines the boundary within which that revelation occurs.
